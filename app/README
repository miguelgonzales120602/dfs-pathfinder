# How to use application:
While app is opened:
1. First tile clicked will be starting node
2. Second tile clicked will be end node
3. Succeeding tiles clicked will be barriers that cannot be traversed.
  Can drag click for black tiles
4. Once start and end nodes are determined, and desired maze is constructed, press 'SPACEBAR' to execute algorithm
5. To repeat, you can press 'C'

# Application Limitations:
1. A large number of traversals can cause hardware issues (crashing), so it was decided that the size of the grid be set to 50 x 50, however this can be modified in the source code.
2. When drag clicking, when going outside the window, an error occurs.
